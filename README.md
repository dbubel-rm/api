# API Serve
The purpose of this framework is to be a very minimal yet production ready API server. It 
was designed with web applications in mind that are primarily handing JSON request/responses.
The framework supports global and route specific middleware (see examples). It also uses `httprouter` under 
the hood for request routing. The server supports load shedding out of the box for production
applications.
